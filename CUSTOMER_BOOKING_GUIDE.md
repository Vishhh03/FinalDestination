# Customer Booking Guide

## New Booking Experience

The booking system has been improved to provide instant confirmation and a smoother booking experience. No more waiting for hotel manager approval!

## How the New System Works

### Instant Confirmation
- Bookings are **automatically confirmed** if rooms are available
- No manual approval needed from hotel managers
- You'll know immediately if your booking is successful

### Real-Time Availability

- See exactly how many rooms are available
- Get instant feedback on your selected dates

## Step-by-Step Booking Process

### 2. Select Your Dates

**Choose Dates:**

### 3. Check Availability

2. Click the "Check Availability" button
3. Wait for the system to verify room availability

**Availability Results:**
- ✅ **Available**: Green message showing available rooms

- Existing bookings for your dates
- Rooms needed for your guest count

3. Click "Confirm Booking"
4. Your booking is instantly confirmed!

### 5. Complete Payment

5. Complete the transaction

**Payment Methods:**

## Understanding Room Availability

### How Rooms Are Calculated

**Guests to Rooms Conversion:**
- 1-2 guests = 1 room
- 3-4 guests = 2 rooms
- 5-6 guests = 3 rooms
- And so on...

**Example:**
- You book for 5 guests
- System needs 3 rooms
- Hotel has 10 total rooms
- 5 rooms already booked for your dates
- Result: 5 available rooms (enough for your booking)

### Overlapping Bookings

The system checks for date overlaps:
- Your check-in is before another booking's check-out
- Your check-out is after another booking's check-in
- These rooms are considered "occupied"

**Example:**
- Hotel has 10 rooms
- Booking A: Jan 1-5 (2 rooms)
- Booking B: Jan 3-7 (3 rooms)
- You want: Jan 4-6
- Available: 10 - 2 - 3 = 5 rooms

## Booking Summary
